Hello!

My name is ImBadAtNaming, but you might also know me as:

- ImBadAtNamingThings
- ImBadAtUsrnmng
- ImBadAtUsernaming

Some people ask me: Why did you pick that name?\
Well, the answer is simple: Just read the name!

\
So, let's start with a bit about me!
- I am from the United States.
- I know Python, and am learning C#.
- One of my dreams is to develop my own game.
- Cheeseburgers are definitely my favorite food.

\
One of my favorite games of all time is Minecraft, which I have played for nearly a decade.
